// Note that ES6 modules cannot directly export class objects.
// This file should be imported using the CommonJS-style:
//   import x = require('[~THE MODULE~]');

// Alternatively, if --allowSyntheticDefaultImports or

// imported as a default import:
//   import x from '[~THE MODULE~]';

// Refer to the TypeScript documentation at

/*~ If you want to expose types from your module as well, you can

 *~ Note that if you decide to include this namespace, the module can be
 *~ incorrectly imported as a namespace object, unless
 *~ --esModuleInterop is turned on:
 *~   import * as x from '[~THE MODULE~]'; // WRONG! DO NOT DO THIS!
